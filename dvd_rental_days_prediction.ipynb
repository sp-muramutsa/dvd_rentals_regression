        "This project aims to figure out how many days a customer will rent a DVD for based on some features. We are going to try out some regression models which will help predict the number of days a customer will rent a DVD using machine learning techniques. Specifically, we are using **regression** machine learning models.\n",

        "\n",
        "The data is provided in the CSV file `rental_info.csv`. It has the following features:\n",
        "\n",
        "- `rental_date`: The date (and time) the customer rents the DVD.\n",
        "- `return_date`: The date (and time) the customer returns the DVD.\n",
        "- `amount`: The amount paid by the customer for renting the DVD.\n",
        "- `amount_2`: The square of `amount`.\n",
        "- `rental_rate`: The rate at which the DVD is rented.\n",
        "- `rental_rate_2`: The square of `rental_rate`.\n",
        "- `release_year`: The year the movie being rented was released.\n",
        "- `length`: Length of the movie being rented, in minutes.\n",
        "- `length_2`: The square of `length`.\n",
        "- `replacement_cost`: The amount it would cost the company to replace the DVD.\n",
        "- `special_features`: Any special features, such as trailers or deleted scenes.\n",
        "- `NC-17`, `PG`, `PG-13`, `R`: Dummy variables indicating the movie's rating. Each is 1 if the movie has that rating, 0 otherwise. (One category is dropped as the reference.)\n"
